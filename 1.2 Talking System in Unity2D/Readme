#so i seperate it into 3 file
#
#Player Movement, is just a simple Movement2D the only change is that i havent add speed change if
#Player are Talking, however it will in the future
#
#TriggerTalking is a script for checking if player are in the correct area by giving TextScript
#a talking ID that will be talk in TextScript section, it done so TriggerTalking can be used
#by other Object.
#
#TextScript is the one iniate the talking and condition to start talking it also contain all the word to talk to
#based on Talking ID and TextIndex this atleast at this moment is another big step on my learning Unity2d and
#i am quite Happy :)
